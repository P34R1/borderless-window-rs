# Borderless-Window-RS

This program will fullscreen any application borderlessly.
The compiled binary when ran will

- Find all the visible windows
- List them out for you to select
- And then fullscreen the program

## THIS PROBABLY ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS

it wasn't tested on any other OS then windows 10, but uses winapi so should work on win11 too.
